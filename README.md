## ðŸ’» Software Developer
I am a software developer with over 5 years of experience building modern web applications across both front-end and full-stack environments. My core expertise lies in JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js, complemented by experience with frameworks and libraries like NgRx, Redux, Vuex, and Pinia for state management.

On the front-end, I focus on creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces, implementing components from Figma prototypes, and applying performance optimization techniques that enhance usability and loading times. On the back-end, I have hands-on experience with Express.js, REST APIs, and databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, delivering scalable and maintainable solutions.

Passionate about clean code and continuous learning, I enjoy contributing to projects where I can turn complex requirements into efficient applications while staying up to date with modern development practices.
